## User Experience UX

I found a good bootstrap template from [Bootstrapmade](https://bootstrapmade.com/) called PhotoFolio. I liked the green colors because
i was making a plant forum and fellt like it was a great fit. It had a nice nav menu that worked good both on computer and on a phone. 

### Agile Method

I used the github projects as a agile tool to manage the planning and implamentation of functions to the site. 
[Project Board](https://github.com/users/GurraNasan/projects/5)

### User Stories

Before i started to write the code a made user stories to for what the user/admin wanted and what they would get from it. 
This are my user stories:
+ [USER STORY: Account registrator](https://github.com/GurraNasan/growing-harmony/issues/1)
+ [USER STORY: Admin](https://github.com/GurraNasan/growing-harmony/issues/8)
+ [USER STORY: Add post](https://github.com/GurraNasan/growing-harmony/issues/3)
+ [USER STORY: Comment on post](https://github.com/GurraNasan/growing-harmony/issues/4)

+ [USER STORY: View like](https://github.com/GurraNasan/growing-harmony/issues/5)
+ [USER STORY: View shop](https://github.com/GurraNasan/growing-harmony/issues/6)

### Data Modal
Before a started i made a model diagram so i would know how to build up the databasa modal and
connect them toghter.

### Future Features
When i was coding i came up with a couple of more features to implant.
User can delete and edit comments, i have the knowledgs to do it, but felt i did not have time
A online shop for merch, i dont have the knowledge yet to do it.
A better design for the post when you choosed a category, with more information.

## Testing

### Bug
I have run in to a couple of bug while you writing the code and i tried to squash them direct when i run in to them. So i forgot to document them. 

But the biggest one was that my css was gone when first deployed the page, to see if it worked

![no_css](documentation/bug/no_css.jpg)

This was fixed by setting debug to False.
